# Seagull Website
Welcome to the Seagull source code! Here is the backend and frontend to the Seagull website. The website is powered by Nextjs due to its seem-less fullstack capabilities. The backend's database is postgresql v17, and uses the `pg` NPM package.
<br> <br>
To start, simply run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. 
<br>
Make sure to have a postgresql database running and insert your postgres connection details in a `.env` file. Do not expose these.
<br> <br>
Currently Seagull is in development.
